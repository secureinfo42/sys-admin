### chroot and dev, proc, sys

*Posted on May 1, 2012*

chroot is a great tool to rescue systems. But a limitation is that /dev, /sys and /proc are not mounted by default but needed for many tasks. This can be done by using mount â€“bind on the host. Here an example how to get a functional chroot:

```
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt
mount -t proc proc proc/
mount -t sysfs sys sys/
mount -o bind /dev dev/
chroot .
```
